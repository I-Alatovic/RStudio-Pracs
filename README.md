- As stated in the description, these R files are solutions for the RStudio pracs for STA2020F 2025 at UCT.

- They are, and will remain, publicly available, but are only intended for current students of this course.

- They were created solely by myself, Isa Alatovic, and are not for sale or redistribution.

- Despite my best efforts to the contrary, there may be some errors in the code - logical, syntactic or otherwise. Please let me know if you find any so I can fix them.

- Please also note that this is my first semester coding in R, and the programs themselves may not be of the best quality.

- I wish you luck with your studies, and please let me know if these programs helped :3
